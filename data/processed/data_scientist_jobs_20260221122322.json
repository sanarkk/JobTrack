      "description": "<h2>About ElevenLabs</h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">ElevenLabs is an AI research and product company transforming how we interact with technology.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We launched in January 2023 with the first human-like AI voice model. Today, we serve millions of users and thousands of businesses - from fast-growing startups to large enterprises like Deutsche Telekom and Meta. Our investors are some of the world's most prominent, including Andreessen Horowitz, ICONIQ Growth and Sequoia. We've raised $781M in funding and our last valuation was $11B - multiples of 11, always.<br /><br />We have expanded from voice into three main platforms:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">ElevenAgents enables businesses to deliver seamless and intelligent customer experiences, with the integrations, testing, monitoring, and reliability necessary to deploy voice and chat agents at scale.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">ElevenCreative empowers creators and marketers to generate and edit speech, music, image, and video across 70+ languages.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">ElevenAPI gives developers access to our leading AI audio foundational models.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Everything we do is the result of the creativity and commitment of our team - builders doing the best work of their lives. We are researchers, engineers, and operators. IOI medalists and ex-founders. If you want to work hard and create lasting positive impact, we want to hear from you.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2>How we work</h2><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>High-velocity: </strong>Rapid experimentation, lean autonomous teams, and minimal bureaucracy.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Impact not job titles: </strong>We don’t have job titles. Instead, it’s about the impact you have. No task is above or beneath you.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>AI first:</strong> We use AI to move faster with higher-quality results. We do this across the whole company—from engineering to growth to operations.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Excellence everywhere: </strong>Everything we do should match the quality of our AI models.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Global team: </strong>We prioritize your talent, not your location.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2>What we offer</h2><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Innovative culture:</strong> You’ll be part of a generational opportunity to define the trajectory of AI, surrounded by a team pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Growth paths: </strong>Joining ElevenLabs means joining a dynamic team with countless opportunities to drive impact - beyond your immediate role and responsibilities.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Learning &amp; development</strong>: ElevenLabs proactively supports professional development through an annual discretionary stipend.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Social travel</strong>: We also provide an annual discretionary stipend to meet up with colleagues each year, however you choose.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Annual company offsite: </strong>Each year, we bring the entire team together in a new location - past offsites have included Croatia and Italy.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Co-working</strong>: If you’re not located near one of our main hubs, we offer a monthly co-working stipend.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This role is remote, so it can be executed globally. If you prefer, you can work from our offices in New York, London and Warsaw.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>About ElevenLabs </strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At ElevenLabs, we are pioneering voice technology with our cutting-edge research and products. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We launched in January 2023 and have since reached over 1 million users globally and have partnered with the world’s biggest names (see <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://elevenlabs.io/blog?category=customer-stories\"><u>customer stories</u></a>).

Millions of people use our technology to read articles, voice over videos, and restore voices lost to disability. Leading developers and enterprises worldwide use ElevenLabs to build intelligent agents for support, sales, and education.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We launched in January 2023 with the first AI model to cross the threshold of human-like speech. In January 2025, we raised a $180 million Series C round, valuing the company at $3.3 billion. By September 2025, that valuation doubled to $6.6 billion as we surpassed $200 million ARR in under three years.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our mission is to build the most important audio AI platform in the world, solve AI audio intelligence, and make information accessible in any voice, language, or sound.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our core offerings are our Creative Platform and the Agents Platform, powered by proprietary Text to Speech, Speech to Text, and conversational AI models.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are just getting started.

You will design and deploy production-ready ML solutions, leveraging cutting-edge platforms like AWS Sagemaker, Vertix, and advanced causal inference techniques such as Double Machine Learning (DML). Your work will not just inform decisions—it will automate, scale, and embed intelligence directly into our operating systems. \n\nThis is a highly technical, hands-on role with direct business impact. You’ll be embedded with senior operators and report directly to a brand CEO or platform leader, supporting mission-critical decisions and creating AI systems that improve themselves over time. \n<br/><br/><b>What you get to do: </b><br/><li>Develop and deploy end-to-end ML pipelines using modern&nbsp;MLOps&nbsp;practices, cloud-native platforms (e.g., AWS&nbsp;Sagemaker), and scalable infrastructure.&nbsp;</li><li>Conduct causal analysis and treatment effect estimation using DML, causal forests, uplift modeling, and other counterfactual inference techniques to guide high-stakes business strategy.&nbsp;</li><li>Build, train, and&nbsp;optimize&nbsp;predictive and prescriptive models for use cases like pricing, promotions, inventory, marketing attribution, and personalization.&nbsp;</li><li>Integrate models into production systems and&nbsp;monitor&nbsp;their performance using advanced observability tools (yes, even&nbsp;Happyface),&nbsp;including diagnosing drift and data quality issues.&nbsp;</li><li>Partner directly with business leaders to translate ambiguous business problems into machine learning frameworks that deliver measurable ROI.&nbsp;</li><li>Collaborate with engineering teams to improve data pipelines, ensure model reproducibility, and&nbsp;maintain&nbsp;version-controlled, CI/CD-enabled ML workflows.&nbsp;</li><li>Continuously research and apply emerging techniques in AI, including generative AI, automated feature engineering, and reinforcement learning.&nbsp;</li><li>Take complex, high-impact problems end&nbsp;to&nbsp;end&nbsp;- from exploration and feature design through model selection,&nbsp;backtesting, and production deployment with clear impact metrics.&nbsp;</li><li>Design robust&nbsp;experiment&nbsp;and&nbsp;quasi-experiment&nbsp;setups (A/B tests, holdouts, staggered rollouts) and recommend approaches when fully randomized tests are not&nbsp;feasible.&nbsp;</li><br/><br/><b>What you bring: </b><br/><li>5+ years of experience in applied data science, machine learning engineering, with a proven track record of deploying ML models into production.</li><li>Master or PhD degree in Data Science, Computer Science, Statistics, Economics, or related quantitative field.</li><li>Expertise in causal inference frameworks—especially Double Machine Learning (DML), A/B testing, uplift modeling, and other counterfactual methods.</li><li>Strong proficiency in Python or R, with hands-on experience in SQL, Jupyter, Git, and cloud ML platforms (AWS Sagemaker experience preferred).</li><li>Familiarity with MLOps tools for experiment tracking, model registry, reproducibility, and automated deployment.</li><li>Experience working with large datasets, distributed computing frameworks, and data engineering best practices.</li><li>Strong experience applying advanced causal and time-series methods in real-world settings, including diagnosing bias, drift, and data quality issues.</li><li>Demonstrated ability to independently take ambiguous, cross-functional problems from zero to a deployed ML solution with clear success metrics and post-launch evaluation.</li><br/><br/><b>Why This Role Is Different</b><br/><li>Most data scientist roles focus on building models that live in notebooks.

Our team is responsible for leading data science initiatives across the global client experience – partnering with Consolidation, Product Marketing, Lifecycle Marketing, and Product Engagement to deliver quantitative insights, personalization, and predictive models that directly shape Wealthsimple's growth strategy.</p><p><br class=\"ProseMirror-trailingBreak\" /></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are a full-stack data science team, meaning we own the end-to-end lifecycle: data modeling, dashboards, predictive models, experiment design and analysis, ad-hoc analysis, and opportunity identification. We operate as consultative partners to our stakeholders – solving problems, identifying opportunities, and owning targeting – not executing tasks. We measure our success by the dollar value we deliver, the ideas we surface that get prioritized, and the model-based solutions we ship that outperform the status quo.</p><p><br class=\"ProseMirror-trailingBreak\" /></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This role will primarily partner with our Consolidation product team, which is focused on creating an incredible first 30-day experience for new clients and driving them to make Wealthsimple their primary financial relationship.

Able to partner closely with product managers and present complex analytical findings to senior leadership.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Curiosity and ownership: willing to dive deep into product strategies, business context, and data to surface insights proactively while handling ambiguity.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Deep expertise in experimental design and causal inference (A/B testing, non-inferiority tests, factorial designs, power analysis, and related methods).

      "description": "<h3>Data Scientist (All Levels)</h3>\n<p><strong>About the company:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The mining industry has steadily become worse at finding new ore deposits, requiring &gt;10X more capital to make discoveries compared to 30 years ago. The easy-to-find, near-surface deposits have largely been found, and the industry has chronically under-invested in new exploration technology, relying on the manual techniques of yesteryear – even as demand accelerates for copper, lithium, and other metals to build electric vehicles, renewable energy, and data centers.</p>\n<p>KoBold builds AI models for mineral exploration and deploys those models—alongside our novel sensors—to guide decisions on KoBold-owned-and-operated exploration programs. In the six years since founding, KoBold has become by far both the largest independent mineral exploration company and the largest exploration technology developer. Our data scientists and software engineers, who come from leading technology companies, jointly lead exploration programs with our renowned exploration geologists.</p>\n<p>KoBold has proven its first discovery with materially less capital than the industry average and found one of the best copper deposits ever discovered: the copper is far more concentrated than the global average of copper mines, and this asset alone is expected to generate meaningful revenue for decades. KoBold has a portfolio of more than 60 other projects, each of which has the potential for another high-quality discovery.</p>\n<p>KoBold is privately held; investors include institutional asset managers T. Rowe Price and Canada Pension Plan Investments; technology venture capitalists Andreessen Horowitz, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, BOND Capital, and Standard Investments; and natural resources companies Equinor, BHP, and Mitsubishi.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are hiring a Data Scientist to help accelerate our mission.</span></p>\n<p><strong>About the position</strong></p>\n<p>In this role, you will build predictive models and apply a wide range of scientific computing, statistical, and physics-based methods to find places where there is evidence of ore-forming processes at work and to predict the locations of ore-grade mineralization in 2D and 3D. You will help build a worldwide dataset that underlies our exploration program, with careful attention to identifying and quantifying uncertainty in the data and in our predictions. You will create models and develop software to accelerate discovery of critical battery metals.</p>\n<p>You will join an outstanding team of data scientists and engineers and will work closely with KoBold’s world-renowned geoscientists to incorporate our best understanding of the chemical and physical processes that create ore deposits. Working with your geoscience colleagues, you will create 2D and 3D geologic predictions, identify exploration targets, design field programs to collect data, and use that data to reduce the uncertainty in our predictions and guide the next phase of field work.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, your role is to help KoBold make valuable discoveries by building data tools to solve scientific problems. As one of the early members of this team, you will help build these tools from the ground up.</p>\n<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>\n<p>The Data Scientist will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Help develop KoBold’s proprietary software exploration tools.</li>\n<li>Find and curate&nbsp; geophysical, geochemical, geologic, and geographic data and integrate it into KoBold’s proprietary data system.</li>\n<li>Build models to make statistically valid predictions about the locations of compositional anomalies within the Earth’s crust.</li>\n<li>Create effective visualizations for evaluating model performance and enabling rapid interaction with the underlying data and key features.</li>\n<li>Develop and apply data processing, statistical, and physics-based techniques to geoscientific data — from computer vision to geophysical inversions — and use the results to guide our targeting efforts and inform our acquisition and exploration decisions.</li>\n<li>Present to and collaborate with our external partners and stakeholders.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p>\n<p>A great Data Scientist candidate will have:</p>\n<p>Technical skills, including extensive experience with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Python’s data science packages and general software engineering practices.</li>\n<li>Collaborative software development (git), and familiarity with software engineering best practices like unit test / integration test suites, and CICD pipelines.</li>\n<li>Cloud computing resources.</li>\n<li>Building predictive models, applying them to different problems, and evaluating and interpreting the results.</li>\n<li>Data from a variety of physical systems.</li>\n<li>Geospatial analyses and visualizations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Technical knowledge:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Broad skills in and knowledge of applied statistics and Bayesian inference</li>\n<li>Substantial understanding of machine learning algorithms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Work practices and motivation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to design, scope and implement technical solutions to novel exploration problems&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Demonstrated ability to quickly absorb and synthesize complex information, with a track record of high intellectual rigor in a professional setting.</li>\n<li>Exceptional curiosity and eagerness to learn, with a proactive approach to exploring new concepts and technologies.</li>\n<li>Excitement about joining a fast-growing early-stage company, comfort with a dynamic work environment, and eagerness to take on a range of responsibilities.</li>\n<li>Ability to independently prioritize multiple tasks effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is also helpful but not required to have experience with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating machine learning models on geospatial data</li>\n<li>Geostatistics</li>\n<li>Image processing or computer vision</li>\n<li>Distributed computing applications for machine learning and other computations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>KoBold Metals is an equal opportunity workplace and an affirmative action employer.

      "description": "<p><strong>Senior Software Engineer, Decision Science</strong></p>\n<p><strong>About the Company&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The mining industry has steadily become worse at finding new ore deposits, requiring &gt;10X more capital to make discoveries compared to 30 years ago. The easy-to-find, near-surface deposits have largely been found, and the industry has chronically under-invested in new exploration technology, relying on the manual techniques of yesteryear – even as demand accelerates for copper, lithium, and other metals to build electric vehicles, renewable energy, and data centers.</p>\n<p>KoBold builds AI models for mineral exploration and deploys those models—alongside our novel sensors—to guide decisions on KoBold-owned-and-operated exploration programs. In the six years since founding, KoBold has become by far both the largest independent mineral exploration company and the largest exploration technology developer. Our data scientists and software engineers, who come from leading technology companies, jointly lead exploration programs with our renowned exploration geologists.</p>\n<p>KoBold has proven its first discovery with materially less capital than the industry average and found one of the best copper deposits ever discovered: the copper is far more concentrated than the global average of copper mines, and this asset alone is expected to generate meaningful revenue for decades. KoBold has a portfolio of more than 60 other projects, each of which has the potential for another high-quality discovery.</p>\n<p>KoBold is privately held; investors include institutional asset managers T. Rowe Price and Canada Pension Plan Investments; technology venture capitalists Andreessen Horowitz, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, BOND Capital, Durable Capital, StepStone, and Standard Investments; and natural resources companies Equinor, BHP, and Mitsubishi.</p>\n<p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>\n<p>At KoBold we believe that a modern scientific computing stack will enable systematic mineral exploration and materially improve our rate of mineral discovery. This role is a key ingredient to this strategy. As a member of our scientific computing team, you will apply decision science techniques in order to build scalable systems to help make high-speed, high-quality decisions for our mineral exploration projects. Collaborating with our exceptional team of data scientists, software engineers, and geologists, you will tackle complex scientific problems head-on and collectively pave the way for discoveries of vital energy transition metals like lithium, copper, nickel, and cobalt. Together we can shape the future of mineral exploration and contribute to building a sustainable world.</p>\n<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Architect, implement, and maintain decision science libraries that will be used in KoBold’s mineral exploration analyses.</li>\n<li>Build tooling to increase the velocity of our decision making, including enabling rapid prototyping in Jupyter notebooks; build experimentation, evaluation, and simulation frameworks; turning successful R&amp;D into robust, scalable pipelines; and organizing ML models and their outputs for repeatability and discoverability.</li>\n<li>Apply–and coach team members to use–engineering best practices such as writing robust, testable and composable code</li>\n<li>Collaborate with data scientists, geoscientists and engineers to invent the modern decision science technology for mineral exploration</li>\n<li>Occasional travel to exploration sites around the world to observe the impact of scientific computing on KoBold’s exploration products and design new technologies to further discovery.&nbsp; Travel is approximately twice per year depending on project needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p>\n<p>Our ideal candidate will have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At least 5 years of experience in the field of decision science with a strong software engineering focus, though most great candidates will have closer to 10.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Track record of building production quality data processing solutions or tooling that have delivered business value</li>\n<li>Proficiency with foundational concepts of ML, including statistical, traditional and deep-learning approaches</li>\n<li>Proficiency in Python, ideally including array-based packages such as xarray and numpy</li>\n<li>Deep experience with measured scientific data</li>\n<li>Experience in visualizing scientific data for domain experts</li>\n<li>Experience in MLops and in the making of robust ML systems</li>\n<li>Drive to increase the velocity and effectiveness of our data scientists in both experimental and production workflows&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Capacity to dive deep on novel challenging problems in applying decision science to mineral exploration, including understanding a complex domain of geology and mineral exploration practices as well as working with limited, disparate and noisy data sources&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Collaborative attitude to work with stakeholders with different backgrounds (data scientists, geoscientists, software engineers, operations)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Work practices and motivation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to take ownership and responsibility of large projects.</li>\n<li>Intellectual curiosity and eagerness to learn about all aspects of mineral exploration, particularly in the geology domain.

Well, we hire for “GRIT”. The textbook definition of GRIT is demonstrating the intersection of passion and perseverance towards long term goals. At Scribd, we are inspired by the potential that this can unlock, and ask each of our employees to pursue a GRIT-ty approach to their work. In a tactical sense, GRIT is also a handy acronym that outlines the standards we hold ourselves and each other to.  Here’s what that means for you: we’re looking for someone who showcases the ability to set and achieve <strong>G</strong>oals, achieve <strong>R</strong>esults within their job responsibilities, contribute <strong>I</strong>nnovative ideas and solutions, and positively influence the broader <strong>T</strong>eam through collaboration and attitude.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>About the Role</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scribd’s Data &amp; Analytics team is hiring a<strong> Lead Data Scientist </strong>to own measurable outcomes across our recommendation surfaces – translating product goals into metrics, leading roadmap bets, and shipping lifts in business results.  You’ll define the offline/online contract end-to-end, design and run experiments, diagnose why variants win or lose, and build prototype models while partnering with Engineering to productionize. You’ll map goals to metrics with clear success criteria, focus on opportunity sizing and measurement, and apply an AI lens (LLMs, embeddings) where it demonstrably improves retrieval, ranking, or understanding—shaping how millions engage with our global content library.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scribd is a differentiated subscription platform with strong organic reach and a vast catalog—books, audiobooks, and hundreds of millions of UGC documents and slides. In a landscape reshaped by AI, our opportunity is to help users cut through noise and discover high-quality, human-centered content. You’ll set north stars and guardrails, create leading indicators that predict long-term outcomes, and build the measurement architecture—identity, attribution windows, metric contracts, and drift/leakage checks—that keeps downstream metrics trustworthy. You’ll also accelerate decision velocity with clear stop/go criteria and power checks, and tell the story through concise decision memos with trade-offs and risks.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>What you’ll do:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Opportunity mapping. Size and prioritize new recs surfaces, intents, and cohorts; trace the funnel and analyze by slice (cold items, long-tail users, platform) to steer the roadmap.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Own the evaluation framework. Define north star &amp; guardrails (e.g. diversity, novelty, duplication, safety); set threshold and tradeoffs, and publish the Objective &amp; Eval Contract per surface.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Offline/Online alignment. Quantify correlation between offline IR metrics (e.g., NDCG@K, MAP, MRR, coverage, calibration) and online KPIs by surface/cohort; publish error bounds and monitor metric drift.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Create leading indicators. Create short-horizon metrics that predict long-term outcomes (e.g., trial to bill-through); backtest and run post-hoc causal checks, reporting uncertainty.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Build the measurement architecture. Set identity &amp; attribution standards (user_id vs. device_id, qualifying events, windows) so downstream metrics (bill-through, churn) are trustworthy.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Design and run advanced experiments such as interleaving tests, pre-register stop/go criteria, and deliver crisp readouts that drive decisions.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Codify schemas, freshness, leakage, and drift checks with Analytics and Data Engineers, establish high quality datasets for Recs algo.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Evaluate when LLMs/embeddings (topics, summaries, semantic similarity) measurably improve offline/online metrics; prototype and hand off clear build specs to ML Eng.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Storytelling and influence.
