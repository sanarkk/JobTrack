      "description": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>SKELAR </strong>is a venture builder that builds international IT product companies according to the rules of the venture capital world. Together with our co-founders, we assemble strong teams to launch tech businesses and win in global markets.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>We are currently looking for a first Data Analyst for Leaply (e-commerce direction).</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are Leaply, an ecosystem of digital and physical products designed to help people build healthy habits and improve their quality of life. We operate in global markets - the US, Tier 1, Europe, and beyond.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In June 2024, we launched an app focused on habit-building, using a subscription-based monetization model and a performance-first marketing approach (Meta, Google, TikTok). Within the first two months, we achieved positive unit economics and are now on track to grow 10x by the end of the year.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our team is building its third business together, with successful exits behind us and a deep understanding of our niche and target audience. We move fast, communicate openly, and set ambitious goals.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>The Role</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are aggressively scaling our physical product direction across <strong>Shopify (DTC)</strong> and <strong>Marketplaces (Amazon, etc.)</strong>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We face a complex data challenge: connecting the dots between aggressive Ad Spend (Meta/TikTok), Web Funnel Performance (Shopify), and Physical Operations (Logistics/Inventory). We need a strong Data Analyst to build the \"Single Source of Truth\" for the business.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You will not just be building charts; you will be the architect of our commercial intelligence. You will help us understand exactly how a creative view on Instagram translates into net profit, accounting for shipping, COGS, and return rates.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>What you’ll do:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Data Unification:</strong> Lead the effort to integrate fragmented data sources (Meta Ads, Shopify, Amazon Seller Central, and other sources of data) into a unified analytical view.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Marketing &amp; Creative Analytics:</strong> Deep dive into ad performance. Move beyond basic ROAS to understand the holistic impact of traffic sources on total ecosystem revenue.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>E-commerce Funnels:</strong> Analyze user journeys to our Shopify store. Evaluate A/B tests on landing pages, checkout flows, and bundles to maximize Conversion Rate and AOV.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Operations &amp; Inventory:</strong> Build dashboards to monitor stock levels and predict inventory depletion. Help us answer \"When do we reorder?\" and \"How much capital is frozen in stock?\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Reporting Ecosystem:</strong> Design and maintain automated dashboards (Tableau) that provide real-time visibility into P&amp;L and Contribution Margin for the Founders and Brand Managers.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>This role is for you if...</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have 3**+ years** of experience in Data Analytics</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have <strong>strong SQL skills</strong> (Window functions, CTEs, complex joins across disparate datasets are second nature to you).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have experience working with <strong>Digital Marketing data</strong> (Meta Ads, Google Ads, etc.).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are proficient with <strong>BI Visualization tools</strong> (Tableau, Looker, or PowerBI) and know how to tell a story with data.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are autonomous. As a Middle+ specialist, you identify gaps in data and fix them without waiting for a ticket.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have confident English level (both colloquial and written).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><br /><strong>SKELAR</strong> is an environment for self-realization of people who are able to create successful companies. We call such companies the next big everything. We believe in their power and scale. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To do this, we have created all the opportunities within our venture builder:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">8 infrastructure teams that help businesses close any issues: from recruiting and communications to finance and legal issues;</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A community of founders who have already launched more than one business and can share practical experience;</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Internal clubs by professional areas: marketing, development, finance, recruiting, brand ambassadorship;</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Trainings, courses, attending conferences;</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Health insurance.</p></li></ul>",

      "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The Battle of Giants exists to answer a simple but important question: <strong><em>Will a company’s strategy lead to growth?</em></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why?</strong> We do this to help investors and corporate execs assess a company’s growth potential and ability to innovate. Critical to survival in this disruptive age. Our ultimate goal is to help organizations design effective strategies. But we can’t do that without first diagnosing how well a company is doing today: Use data to benchmark management performance. Does our mission align with yours?</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What’s your role?&nbsp;</strong>As Data Analyst, you will help analyze and publish insights on different companies’ growth initiatives: How they compare to the competition, and what it means for their future. Taking on both analyst and story teller roles. It won’t be easy. You will perform much research, data cleaning, and writing. It requires good knowledge on economics, corporate strategy and of course, data analysis. But you won’t be alone. A team of data engineers, developers and fellow analysts will help you achieve your goals. The problems you’ll help the team solve include:</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">How can we best transform the data for analysis?</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">How can we improve the data features feeding the machine learning algorithm?</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">How can we best visualize and communicate the insight?</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">What are core elements of an investigative story and what’s irrelevant?</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">How can we make the insights we share more actionable for clients?</p></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Toolkit?&nbsp;</strong>We don’t believe in hiring based on tools you have experience with. We’re much more interested in people who can find the root cause of a problem, and research/learn the best tool to help solve it. Does that sound like you? But to give you an idea... we currently use tools including Python/NLTK, SQL in Mode, Tableau, Trello, etc., but we are more than willing to drop them if you identify more effective toolkits.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What should you expect?&nbsp;</strong>This job is NOT for those who struggle with ambiguity, need guidance, and say yes without asking why. We seek a leader, not a follower. Someone not afraid to speak up and stand up for the right ideas. That’s because you will work directly with the founding team and help shape the long-term outlook for The Battle of Giants. Do you enjoy getting outside your comfort zone? Do you naturally question assumptions, investigate root cause of problems, and think outside the box?</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What benefits are offered?</strong> We strongly believe in smelling the roses along the journey. It’s going to be a long and challenging journey. We thus offer supplemental health coverage, 4 weeks paid time off, unlimited sick days, and the opportunity to design your own workstation/computer setup. We also encourage you to take Friday to work on something different and think outside the box: Volunteer, create art, build something useful for the community.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What happens after you apply?&nbsp;</strong>We will shortlist candidates we believe will be most successful in this role, and send along a quick exercise as the next step. This helps you get a sense of the day to day work. And it also helps us understand how you think. There will be multiple ways to complete the exercise, so don’t worry about finding an ideal solution. Do what you would normally do, using the tools you’re familiar with. We just want to learn about you!</p>",

Is the sentiment positive?\"</li>\n<li>Cross-Functional Data Partnership: Leverage Product Adoption Intelligence to identify \"At-Risk\" signals and partner with Finance to ensure data aligns for accurate reporting.</li>\n<li>Jira Accountability &amp; Structure: Partner with the Senior Manager of Analytics to bring structure to the team's work. You will help manage backlogs and ensure visibility, ensuring we are building the right things at the right time.</li>\n<li>Documentation &amp; Best Practices: Partner with the teams on the creation and maintenance of data dictionaries and enablement documentation in Confluence.

You are Agile &amp; Growth-Oriented, adapting quickly to pivots (like our Enterprise strategy) and focusing on solutions rather than fixed mindsets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>WHO YOU ARE:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solution seeker. You’re focused on tackling new challenges, solving problems, and moving the business forward—and you don’t wait to be asked.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lifelong learner.

This role is our first <strong>embedded</strong> Data Analyst: you will be a full member of the Data Team, but your day-to-day priorities will come from our Revenue Operations (RevOps) organization to support the entire Go-to-Market (GTM) function.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is <em>not</em> a generic “business analyst” role - this is a modern Data Analyst role requiring fluency in the data warehouse, strong analytical rigor, and the ability to work end-to-end (from raw or lightly modeled data through final insight, modeling adjustments, and BI deliverables). Your analytical standards, modeling practices, and approach to problem-solving will be developed and maintained in close partnership with the Data Team, while your project portfolio will be shaped by RevOps.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As an embedded analyst, you will serve as the analytical counterpart to RevOps leadership: helping to scope business questions, build robust data assets, design metrics and dashboards, and communicate insights that influence GTM strategy. A strong working knowledge of GTM motions in B2B SaaS will help you excel, though deep curiosity and strong fundamentals can also make up the difference.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Because this role sits at the intersection of RevOps and the Data Team, you’ll have broad ownership and visibility across domains. You will work on everything from revenue funnel diagnostics and sales efficiency analyses to marketing cohort performance, capacity planning, retention/expansion patterns, and operational metrics that help our GTM leaders run the business. You will also contribute to the underlying data models and help mature the analytical operating system for GTM at Ashby.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you’re a technically strong Data Analyst who enjoys owning the full analytical lifecycle, partnering directly with business stakeholders, and improving the modeling and data products that sustain an organization, this role will be an excellent fit. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2>Requirements</h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The essence of this role dictates that you must be analytical, conversant in statistical reasoning, and capable of managing the data you work with from inception through synthesis of results in the appropriate downstream assets. There are a lot of ways to meet those responsibilities. If the dot product of your skill vector with this requirements vector is close to 1, please consider applying, but please note it does not have to be 1.0. </p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Expertise in SQL-based data analysis</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Strong in analytical and statistical thinking - you must be able to generate insights</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Expertise with data visualization (i.e. visual communication of results)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Interest in working directly with business partners, i.e. go-to-market stakeholders, to identify and plan related analysis efforts</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Proficiency building internal “data products” based on your analysis results, e.g. high-usage dashboards via BI tools (Looker, Tableau, etc) for various business partners</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Excellent written and verbal communication. Ashby has a writing-centric culture, but you will also be responsible for direct collaboration with various teammates</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Very detail-oriented: in your analysis work you can anticipate complications and identify bad-but-not-obviously-wrong data discrepancies</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Proficiency in Python (primarily in the domain of data analysis and visualization)</p></li></ul><h3>You could be a great fit if</h3><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You identify as exceptionally curious by nature</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You want to operate as a true Data Analyst embedded in a business function—combining stakeholder-facing work with deep technical execution</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You could pass as an “analytics engineer” or have working proficiency in dbt-based data modeling</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have been a first or early data analyst at a growing, fast-moving startup</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have strong working knowledge of GTM motions in B2B SaaS: sales, marketing, customer success, pipeline forecasting, and revenue analytics</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have an intuition for solving problems pragmatically and an eye for leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You enjoy collaboration and find reward in enabling other teammates to succeed</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have strong, experience-backed opinions about data products and data culture in a company setting</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Familiarity with our data stack is a bonus, but not a requirement</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Have a passion for refining the role of data within company environments, spanning everything from communication standards and data request management - you’ll help shape this as Ashby grows</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You can appreciate the whole distribution as much as a point estimator</p></li></ul><h3>Reasons not to apply</h3><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Spreadsheet-only analytical backgrounds are not a match for this role; fluency with SQL in a modern data warehouse is essential.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You do not enjoy working directly with non-analysts or other business stakeholders. This role will require working closely with teammates across the company as various data-related needs come up.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are looking for consumer-scale data infrastructure projects. We have a huge and interesting set of data to work with (check out our data trends reports!), but we are a B2B SaaS company. Relative to B2C services, we might best be considered small but mighty :)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are seeking an in-person work experience. Although there are hot spots of Ashby employees around the world, Ashby is a remote workplace. Rest assured, we do meet up in person for various events throughout the year!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You want to be on a large team of analysts. The Data Team at Ashby is extremely lean, so you will be primarily working with a data engineering partner, our first data analyst, and your manager (me!). That said, you will be working directly with many team members across the company, so your teammates in the analysis sense will be the diversity of folks you collaborate with from project to project.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2>Data Culture at Ashby</h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we draw a clear distinction between when to look to data for \"the answer\" and when to use data to aid principled thinking for decision making. In general, a primary consideration is whether or not data is needed to help clarify points of uncertainty. When data is considered necessary, a secondary consideration is to what depth data will be required. Data questions lend themselves to ongoing \"what about...\" or \"what if...\" explorations, which can be important in some situations but are not always necessary. <br /><br />With these dynamics in mind, we do not foster an environment where every decision we make should be backed by data, but we do foster an environment where teammates ask whether or not data will fit the task at hand well. This, in turn, allows us to operate a lean team focused on projects where data provides true leverage to our overall business and product goals.<br /><br />As a related but distinct point, Ashby’s data culture, as far as transparency and access goes, is very open. We share company-wide access to our financial standings, progress, goals, and generally make any data and reporting results broadly available. Outside of constraints related to whether a teammate has access to a particular tool, there are close to no constraints on access the state of the company as told by data or reporting. In general, we would like to continue and extend open access to data throughout the company (with your help!), but with consideration and not as a substitute for principled thinking :)</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2>Ashby's Data Stack</h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As it will undoubtedly be a point of interest, a quick summary of our data stack is provided here. Our production database is postgres, which we integrate into a Snowflake data warehouse via Polytomic. All other business systems are integrated via Fivetran (the GTM stack involves HubSpot as our CRM and Stripe, most notably). We use Prefect for orchestration and dbt for data modeling. Frontend event tracking is done via Rudderstack. Data visualization and reporting varies, but the broader company is primarily served standardized analytics via Omni Analytics. For version control we use Git/Github (and Github Actions for CI/CD). As an Analyst, you'll be at liberty to work in a notebook or tool of your choice, but Hex is the burgeoning standard and likely recommendation. Internal documentation lives in Slab and dbt docs. <br /><br />A core part of the data stack at Ashby is the actual people! As mentioned, we are a lean team, and the current structure is myself as the manager, a single data engineer and two data analysts. You would be our third data analyst joining the team, and the first data analyst embedded in the Go To Market organization. All members of the Data Team maintain a strong sense of ownership and agency in their work, but the broader responsibility comes with broader leeway. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2>Interview Process</h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is thorough. We aim to ensure each person that joins the team is the right fit for Ashby and will provide ample information for you to assess if Ashby is the right fit for you. The process for this role is as follows:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hiring Manager Screen (30 mins)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Take Home Assignment: Mini Analysis and Write-up (~3-4 hours)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Final Round - Virtual Onsite (~2.5, can be split into multiple days)</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">(45 mins) Analysis Projects Deep Dive</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">(30 mins) Working with Data Engineering</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">(30 mins) Working with Go-to-Market Stakeholders</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">(30 mins) Chat with a Founder</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">(15 mins) Follow-Up Conversation + Debrief with the Hiring Manager</p></li></ul></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Note:</strong> please do not reach out to the broader Ashby team requesting more information or time to connect.

You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><br />If you've made it this far and are excited about Ashby, please apply and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/ashbyhq\">follow us on LinkedIn</a> to stay up to date!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.
