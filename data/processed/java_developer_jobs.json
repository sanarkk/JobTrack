At certain points during our recruiting process, we rely on AI to improve your experience. This could be during resume review or curating personalized job recommendations, asking you clarifying questions via a chatbot or during our interview scheduling to improve your experience. Our use of AI helps ensure we combat bias by evaluating candidates equally and fairly, without seeing identity information, such as your name, or gender for example). AI also helps us better predict successful hires by reviewing all applicants for a role and the relationship between your skills, experience and likely success at PwC Canada. While AI supports parts of our recruitment process, final hiring decisions always involve human review. For more information about our use and protection of your data, please refer to our Privacy Policy (https://www.pwc.com/ca/en/privacy-policy.html).<p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p>Nous tenons à répondre à vos besoins tout au long du processus de demande d’emploi, d’entrevue et d’embauche. Si vous avez besoin de mesures d’adaptation pour être parfaitement à l’aise, faites-le-nous savoir à l’étape de la demande d’emploi.<p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p>L’utilisation de l’intelligence artificielle (IA) dans le domaine du recrutement en est à ses balbutiements. Nous savons que vous pourriez vous demander comment et pourquoi nous y avons recours. À certains stades de notre processus de recrutement, nous comptons sur l’IA pour améliorer votre expérience. Par exemple, pendant l’examen du curriculum vitæ ou l’élaboration d’une liste de recommandations personnalisées, un agent conversationnel pourrait vous demander des précisions ou fixer avec vous un rendez-vous pour l’entrevue. L’IA nous aide à mieux lutter contre les préjugés, car l’évaluation des candidats se fait de façon juste et équitable, sans que les informations d’identification comme le nom ou le sexe soient connues. Elle nous permet également de mieux repérer les bons candidats pour un poste et d’évaluer le lien entre leurs compétences, leur expérience et leurs chances de réussir chez PwC Canada. Bien que l’IA facilite certaines étapes de notre processus de recrutement, les décisions finales d’embauche sont toujours prises par des personnes.

At certain points during our recruiting process, we rely on AI to improve your experience. This could be during resume review or curating personalized job recommendations, asking you clarifying questions via a chatbot or during our interview scheduling to improve your experience. Our use of AI helps ensure we combat bias by evaluating candidates equally and fairly, without seeing identity information, such as your name, or gender for example). AI also helps us better predict successful hires by reviewing all applicants for a role and the relationship between your skills, experience and likely success at PwC Canada. While AI supports parts of our recruitment process, final hiring decisions always involve human review. For more information about our use and protection of your data, please refer to our Privacy Policy (https://www.pwc.com/ca/en/privacy-policy.html).<p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p>Nous tenons à répondre à vos besoins tout au long du processus de demande d’emploi, d’entrevue et d’embauche. Si vous avez besoin de mesures d’adaptation pour être parfaitement à l’aise, faites-le-nous savoir à l’étape de la demande d’emploi.<p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p>L’utilisation de l’intelligence artificielle (IA) dans le domaine du recrutement en est à ses balbutiements. Nous savons que vous pourriez vous demander comment et pourquoi nous y avons recours. À certains stades de notre processus de recrutement, nous comptons sur l’IA pour améliorer votre expérience. Par exemple, pendant l’examen du curriculum vitæ ou l’élaboration d’une liste de recommandations personnalisées, un agent conversationnel pourrait vous demander des précisions ou fixer avec vous un rendez-vous pour l’entrevue. L’IA nous aide à mieux lutter contre les préjugés, car l’évaluation des candidats se fait de façon juste et équitable, sans que les informations d’identification comme le nom ou le sexe soient connues. Elle nous permet également de mieux repérer les bons candidats pour un poste et d’évaluer le lien entre leurs compétences, leur expérience et leurs chances de réussir chez PwC Canada. Bien que l’IA facilite certaines étapes de notre processus de recrutement, les décisions finales d’embauche sont toujours prises par des personnes.

At certain points during our recruiting process, we rely on AI to improve your experience. This could be during resume review or curating personalized job recommendations, asking you clarifying questions via a chatbot or during our interview scheduling to improve your experience. Our use of AI helps ensure we combat bias by evaluating candidates equally and fairly, without seeing identity information, such as your name, or gender for example). AI also helps us better predict successful hires by reviewing all applicants for a role and the relationship between your skills, experience and likely success at PwC Canada. While AI supports parts of our recruitment process, final hiring decisions always involve human review.

Si vous avez besoin de mesures d’adaptation pour être parfaitement à l’aise, faites-le-nous savoir à l’étape de la demande d’emploi.<p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p>L’utilisation de l’intelligence artificielle (IA) dans le domaine du recrutement en est à ses balbutiements. Nous savons que vous pourriez vous demander comment et pourquoi nous y avons recours. À certains stades de notre processus de recrutement, nous comptons sur l’IA pour améliorer votre expérience. Par exemple, pendant l’examen du curriculum vitæ ou l’élaboration d’une liste de recommandations personnalisées, un agent conversationnel pourrait vous demander des précisions ou fixer avec vous un rendez-vous pour l’entrevue. L’IA nous aide à mieux lutter contre les préjugés, car l’évaluation des candidats se fait de façon juste et équitable, sans que les informations d’identification comme le nom ou le sexe soient connues. Elle nous permet également de mieux repérer les bons candidats pour un poste et d’évaluer le lien entre leurs compétences, leur expérience et leurs chances de réussir chez PwC Canada. Bien que l’IA facilite certaines étapes de notre processus de recrutement, les décisions finales d’embauche sont toujours prises par des personnes.

      "description": "<div class=\"content-intro\"><p>Elastic, the Search AI Company, enables everyone to find the answers they need in real time, using all their data, at scale — unleashing the potential of businesses and people. The Elastic Search AI Platform, used by more than 50% of the Fortune 500, brings together the precision of search and the intelligence of AI to enable everyone to accelerate the results that matter. By taking advantage of all structured and unstructured data — securing and protecting private information more effectively — Elastic’s complete, cloud-based solutions for search, security, and observability help organizations deliver on the promise of AI.</p></div><h2><strong>What is The Role</strong></h2>\n<p>We're looking for a Senior Software Developer to join the team that’s contributing to improving our storage efficiency for metrics, logs, and other types of data, advancing our <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/esql.html\" target=\"_blank\">ES|QL</a> solution to query such data, as well as optimizing the storage layout for object storage.</p>\n<p>As a software engineer in the team, you will work on different initiatives, such as enhancing current logging solutions to ensure that logging data is always accepted and persisted, advancing our current metrics processing capabilities to ensure massive and seamless adoption by our customers, and improving storage efficiency across the board. You’ll also be extending the logic for efficiently querying and aggregating the stored data, taking their storage layout and ordering into account.</p>\n<p>Our company is distributed by intention. We hire the best engineers we can find wherever they are, whoever they are. We collaborate across continents every day over email, GitHub, Zoom, and Slack. At our best, we write fast, scalable, intuitive, and high-quality software. We believe that the best way to do that is to empower individual engineers, code review every change, decide big things by consensus, and strive for incremental improvements.</p>\n<h2><strong>What You Will Be Doing</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You’ll work with a globally distributed team of experienced engineers focused on data storage mechanisms and query capabilities of Elasticsearch.</li>\n<li>You'll be an expert in the storage engine area, and everyone will turn to you when they have a question about it. You'll improve those areas based on your questions and your instincts.</li>\n<li>You'll be a full-time Elasticsearch contributor, building data-intensive new features, fixing intriguing bugs, and increasing the testing coverage, all while making the code easier to understand.</li>\n<li>You will design and implement advanced algorithms and data structures, often working at the system and hardware level. You’ll also engage with our global community for triaging and resolving issues and pull requests.</li>\n<li>You'll write idiomatic modern Java -- Elasticsearch is 99.8% Java!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What You Bring</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You have strong core Java skills and are conversant in the standard library of data structures and concurrency constructs.</li>\n<li>You have an excellent understanding of concurrent and parallel programming principles.</li>\n<li>You have an excellent background in applied data processing (data structures, algorithms).</li>\n<li>You are familiar with storage systems and low-level abstractions in OS.</li>\n<li>You work with a high level of autonomy and are able to take on projects and guide them from beginning to end. This covers both technical design and working with other engineers to develop needed components.</li>\n<li>You have solid software engineering foundations, with a proven track record of designing and delivering high-quality solutions.</li>\n<li>You're comfortable developing collaboratively. Giving and receiving feedback on code, approaches, and APIs is hard! Bonus points if you've collaborated over the internet because that's harder. Double bonus points for asynchronous collaboration over the internet. That's even harder, but we do it anyway because it's the best way we know how to build software.</li>\n<li>You've used several data storage technologies like Elasticsearch, Solr, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Cassandra, and have some idea how they work and why they work that way.</li>\n<li>You have excellent verbal and written communication skills. Like we said, collaborating on the internet is hard. We try to be respectful, empathetic, and trusting in all of our interactions. And we'd expect that from you too.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bonus Points</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You've built things with Elasticsearch before.</li>\n<li>You’ve worked on data storage technology.</li>\n<li>You have experience designing, leading, and owning cross-functional initiatives.</li>\n<li>You've worked with open source projects and are familiar with different styles of source control workflow and continuous integration.</li>\n<li>You have past working experience with database, search engine, OS, or cloud service development.</li>\n</ul><div class=\"content-pay-transparency\"><div class=\"pay-input\"><div class=\"description\"><p>Compensation for this role is in the form of base salary.&nbsp; This role does not have a variable compensation component.&nbsp; The typical starting salary range for new hires in this role is listed below.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These ranges represent the lowest to highest salary we reasonably and in good faith believe we would pay for this role at the time of this posting.&nbsp; We may ultimately pay more or less than the posted range, and the ranges may be modified in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An employee's position within the salary range will be based on several factors including, but not limited to, relevant education, qualifications, certifications, experience, skills, geographic location, performance, and business or organizational needs.</p>\n<p>Elastic believes that employees should have the opportunity to share in the value that we create together for our shareholders. Therefore, in addition to cash compensation, this role is currently eligible to participate in Elastic's stock program.&nbsp; Our total rewards package also includes a company-matched Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) with dollar-for-dollar matching up to 6% of eligible earnings, along with a range of other benefits offered with a holistic emphasis on employee well-being.</p></div><div class=\"title\">The typical starting salary range for this role is:</div><div class=\"pay-range\"><span>$128,300</span><span class=\"divider\">&mdash;</span><span>$203,000 CAD</span></div></div></div><div class=\"content-conclusion\"><h2><strong>Additional Information - We Take Care of Our People</strong></h2>\n<p>As a distributed company, diversity drives our identity. Whether you’re looking to launch a new career or grow an existing one, Elastic is the type of company where you can balance great work with great life. Your age is only a number. It doesn’t matter if you’re just out of college or your children are; we need you for what you can do.</p>\n<p>We strive to have parity of benefits across regions and while regulations differ from place to place, we believe taking care of our people is the right thing to do.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Competitive pay based on the work you do here and not your previous salary</li>\n<li>Health coverage for you and your family in many locations</li>\n<li>Ability to craft your calendar with flexible locations and schedules for many roles</li>\n<li>Generous number of vacation days each year</li>\n<li>Increase your impact - We match up to $2000 (or local currency equivalent) for financial donations and service</li>\n<li>Up to 40 hours each year to use toward volunteer projects you love</li>\n<li>Embracing parenthood with minimum of 16 weeks of parental leave</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Different people approach problems differently.
