At the time, their mission was to provide easy and affordable access to public records. Something that in 2007 was only really accessible to corporations. Since then, their mission has expanded to developing products and services that grant access to information and data across a number of verticals. In service of this mission, LTV has 10 consumer brands, including BeenVerified, NumberGuru, PeopleLooker, NeighborWho, Ownerly, PeopleSmart, Bumper, ReversePhone, MoneyBot5000, and Wingmate.<br>Our mission is to develop a diverse portfolio of technologies, products, and services that give all people equal access to unbiased data and information. We believe that through this access, people can empower and protect themselves in today&#8217;s ever-changing world, filled with fake news, deception, and a lack of transparency.<br>&#160;",
